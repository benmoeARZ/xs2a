== Return extended errors from SPI Level: changes in SpiResponse
Before these changes errors in the SPI Level were bound to four possible values: TECHNICAL_FAILURE,
UNAUTHORIZED_FAILURE, LOGICAL_FAILURE, NOT_SUPPORTED.

For some use cases this is not enough and SPI Developer may need to provide another error or even list of errors.
For this reason SpiResponse class is changed: now it provides a list of errors, that contain TppMessage container.
SPI Developer may provide several errors with own error code. Error codes are bound to the NextGenPSD2 Specification.
HTTP error code will be identified by first error in the list.

For this reason SpiResponseStatus is now deprecated and will be removed after some version. Success path means no errors in the list.
Unsuccess path means at least one error in the errors list in SpiResponse.
Also SpiResponse will support only builder in the future. No constructors will be supported anymore.

== Add TPP info endpoint in `csm-aspsp` API

From now on, the endpoint for getting information by TPP (GET `aspsp-api/v1/tpp/{tpp-id}`) is created.

== Bugfix: Consent-related endpoints return incorrect HTTP status code on providing unknown consent ID

From now on, AIS endpoints that take consent ID as a path parameter will return `CONSENT_UNKNOWN` error with HTTP status
 code `403` instead of `400` if the consent couldn't be located by the provided ID.

The following endpoints were affected by this change:

- Get Status Request (`GET /v1/consents/{consentId}/status`)
- Delete an Account Information Consent Object (`DELETE /v1/consents/{consentId}`)
- Start the authorisation process in context of an Account Information Consent Request (`POST /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations`)
- Update PSU Data in context of an Account Information Consent Request (`PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`)
- Get Authorisation Sub-Resources Request in context of an Account Information Consent Request (`GET /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations`)
- Get SCA Status Request in context of an Account Information Consent Request (`GET /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`)

== Bugfix: Validate `entryReferenceFrom` and `deltaList` parameters in `Read Transaction List` request

Parameter `deltaReportSupported` was removed from ASPSP Profile.
From now on, ASPSP Profile has two parameters: `deltaListSupported` and `entryReferenceFromSupported` that indicate the support of corresponding parameters in `Read Transaction List` request `GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions`.
When TPP sends request and it has either `entryReferenceFrom` or `deltaList` parameter, and ASPSP doesn't support them, then TPP will receive `400 Bad Request` error with `PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED` code.
If ASPSP supports both parameters and TPP sends request with these two parameters, it will also receive `400 Bad Request` error with `FORMAT_ERROR` code.

== Bugfix: Сreate consent request and update PSU authorisation request returns empty list of scaMethods in response

From now on, the responses for these requests don't include empty list of scaMethods in case when no SCA methods
are returned from SPI level:

- POST `/v1/consents`;
- PUT `/v1/consents/{consent_id}/authorisations/{authorisation_id}`.

== Bugfix: Accept Authentication Type from ASPSP even if it is not described in Specification

From now on, `ASPSP` can provide `Authentication Types` (`SMS_OTP`, `OTHER_OTP`) of `SCA methods`, which are not described in `Specification`.
There is possibility to accept `Authentication Types` from `ASPSP` and process them to `XS2A` response on following requests:
Update PSU Data for `Payment initiation`
Update PSU Data for `Payment cancellation`
Update PSU Data for `Consent`

== Bugfix: Validate `bookingStatus` query parameter in `Read Transaction List` request

From now on, mandatory `bookingStatus` query parameter is being validated in `Read Transaction List` request
(`GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions {query-parameters}`).
To be considered valid, this parameter should be present in request, have a valid value (`booked`, `pending` or `both`) and be supported by the ASPSP.
ASPSP can indicate supported values by adding them to the `availableBookingStatuses` property in the ASPSP profile.
If `bookingStatus` parameter has invalid value, `400 FORMAT_ERROR` error will be returned in the response.
If value is correct, but is not supported by the ASPSP, `400 PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED` error will be returned instead.

== Bugfix: `creditorAddress` property is provided to the SPI in payment object even if it was not present in the request

Parameter `creditorAddress` in `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.domain.payment.SpiSinglePayment` and `de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.domain.payment.SpiPeriodicPayment`
will be set to null if it is absent in the `initiatePayment` request (`POST /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}`)

== Added validation of accept header for getting transaction list (`GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions`)

Configuration property `supportedTransactionApplicationTypes` was added to bank profile with list of supported headers (JSON, XML, TEXT).

* `Accept` header (if it is presented in request) should be one of application/json, application/xml or text/plain and configured in bank profile.
* If property `supportedTransactionApplicationTypes` is not configured validation will not be applied and header can be one of JSON, XML, TEXT as in specification.
* If header `Accept` is not provided in request - respond with JSON format.

== Bugfix: `Get Consent` request doesn't return mandated `lastActionDate` attribute in response body

Until now, when TPP made first `Get Consent` request, `lastActionDate` field was absent in the response.
From now on, the value of the `lastActionDate` field is set to the current date when AIS Consent is created and will always be present in the `Get Consent` response.
will be set to null if it is absent in the `initiatePayment` request (`POST /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}`)

== Bugfix: Links `startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification` and `updatePsuIdentification` should be never used in responses

From now on, XS2A would not return links `startAuthorisationWithPsuIdentification` and `updatePsuIdentification` during
starting or updating the AIS consent or PIS payment authorisation. Links `startAuthorisationWithPsuAuthentication` and
`updatePsuAuthentication` will be returned instead. The reason for that: our implementation already supports password
receiving on startAuthorisation, therefore no need to separate Identification (PSU-ID) and Authentication (Password).

== Bugfix: Payment Cancellation Request update

From now on, the endpoint for payment cancellation (DELETE `/v1/{payment_service}/{payment_product}/{payment_id}`) returns :
 - response code 405 and message `CANCELLATION_INVALID` in case when payment has finalized status
 - response code 204 and no response body in response in case when SCA is not required
 - response code 202 and links in response body according current SCA approach in case when SCA is required

Added new `TPP-Explicit-Authorisation-Preferred` header to the endpoint for payment cancellation.

== Bugfix: Periodic payment can be created with invalid `dayOfExecution` tag

From now on, while creating the periodic payment (`POST /v1/periodic-payments/{payment-product}`) the `dayOfExecution` field is validated:
it has to be a string representation of a day of the month (1-31), violating this returns `400 FORMAT_ERROR`.

== Delete "accounts" field in PiisConsentEntity, deprecated methods and "piis_consent_acc_reference" table

Table `piis_consent_acc_reference` and field in `PiisConsentEntity` were removed as deprecated.

== Delete `createAuthorization` method in AisConsentAuthorisationServiceBase

Method `createAuthorization` in AisConsentAuthorisationServiceBase was removed. From now on,
createAuthorizationWithResponse(String consentId, AisConsentAuthorizationRequest request) method will be used instead.

== Bugfix: `Get Cancellation Authorisation Sub-Resources` request (`GET /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/cancellation-authorisations`) returns wrong JSON format

From now on, `Get Cancellation Authorisation Sub-Resources` request returns correct response with `cancellationIds` field, that contains list of cancellation authorisations

== Bugfix: `authorisationId` field is not provided in the responses

From now on, while getting the response for these requests:
 - AIS consent starting authorisation,
 - PIS payment starting authorisation,
 - PIS payment cancellation authorisation

the response has `authorisationId` field.

== Bugfix: Fixed count usage of frequencyPerDay for one-off consents for every account endpoint

`frequencyPerDay` is counted per unique resource for each endpoint when `recurringIndicator` of the consent is set to `false`.
Every access on the following endpoints is counted by one-off consent, where pagination on transactions are resulting
in counting all accesses to this transaction report as one access:

* `GET /v1/accounts`;
* `GET /v1/accounts/account-id` per account-id;
* `GET /v1/accounts/account-id/transactions` per account-id;
* `GET /v1/accounts/account-id/balances` per account-id;
* `GET /v1/accounts/account-id/transactions/transaction-id` per account-id and transaction-id, if applicable.

Also, a new scheduled task was added in CMS to be executed by Spring Scheduler. To set up the periodicity of this task
execution, the new property `used-non-recurring-consent-expiration.cron.expression` was added to the
`application.properties` file(current value is set to run at the top of every hour of every day).

== Bugfix: `Read Transaction List` request returns empty lists with transactions

From now on, response to the `Read Transaction List` request (`GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions`) will no longer
return empty lists with transactions, if they weren't provided by the ASPSP.
