== Feature: Separated redirect URL timeout and Authorisation expiration timeout

From now on, new field is added to bank_profile - `authorisationExpirationTimeMs`. This field indicates the period of authorisation
expiration in milliseconds and influences payment authorisation, payment cancellation authorisation and consent authorisation.
All calls for updating data from online-banking to the CMS-PSU-API can be processed until the authorisation timeout is not expired.
In case this time is expired the `408 REQUEST_TIMEOUT` response is given.

Also, new endpoints were added to CMS-PSU-API in scope of this feature:

 - `GET /psu-api/v1/payment/authorisation/{authorisation-id}` to get PIS authorisation object by its ID,
 - `GET /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/authorisation/{authorisation-id}` to get AIS authorisation object by its ID.

## Bugfix: Fix the payment ID transfer flow during payment cancellation

From now on, response to the Payment Cancellation Request (`DELETE /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}`)
will contain links with external (encrypted) payment ID instead of internal one.

## Bugfix: Account reference is properly validated during confirmation of funds

From now on, account reference in the Funds Confirmation Request (`POST /v1/funds-confirmations`)
will be properly validated (both account identifier and currency).

## Bugfix: BankOffered consent after authorisation should allow accesses according to chosen by PSU

From now on, request for changing AIS Consent accesses in CMS (`PUT /psu-api/v1/ais/consent/{consent-id}/save-access`) can get
`combinedServiceIndicator` and `recurringIndicator` parameters.
Based on new incoming data of accesses Consent changes `AisConsentRequestType` field to any of next values:

 - GLOBAL
 - ALL_AVAILABLE_ACCOUNTS
 - DEDICATED_ACCOUNTS

And when TPP requests to `Read Account Data` with this Consent ID xs2a will respond according to updated authorised accesses.

## Extend logging for XS2A

Logs for XS2A `Authorisation`, `AIS`, `PIS`, `PIIS` and `Validation` services were extended with
covering so-called “unhappy paths”.
Logs provides important IDs, but never log request data like payment data or consent accounts.
For filtering through specific request each log were specified by `X-Request-ID` parameter.
Logging is used `INFO` level. You can find other settings at `logback-spring.xml`.
Logs are printed to Console and stored to main project directory “logs” folder.
Each day are stored separately at file like `2019-06-19.0.log` with 10Mb max size.

## Delete `isTransactionFeeIndicator` method in SpiPaymentInitiationResponse

Method `isTransactionFeeIndicator` in SpiPaymentInitiationResponse was removed. From now on,
use `getTransactionFeeIndicator` method instead.

## Delete extra constructor in SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse

`SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse(SpiAccountAccess, boolean)` constructor was removed from SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse
and `SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse(SpiAccountAccess, boolean, String)` was replaced with the Lombok `@AllArgsConstructor` version.

## Bugfix: Read or update info by another TPP

From now on, while sending HTTP requests to the XS2A for all components (AIS, or PIIS)
where TPP info from certificate is not correct validators will return an error with HTTP code 400 and message 'CONSENT_UNKNOWN'

## Feature: Requests with custom 'tpp-qwac-certificate' header

From now on, all HTTP requests to the XS2A could contain custom 'tpp-qwac-certificate' header even if 'mockspi' profile is used

## Bugfix: Fix saving of TPP redirect URIs after payment cancellation
Headers `TPP-Redirect-URI` and `TPP-Nok-Redirect-URI` for Payment Cancellation Request (`DELETE /v1/{payment_service}/{payment_product}/{payment_id}`) are stored in `tpp_info` table.
Added validators for headers: `tpp-redirect-uri`, `x-request-id` and `tpp-explicit-authorisation-preferred` for Cancellation Payment Request (`DELETE /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}`).

## Bugfix: Missing validation for 'withBalance' with multiple accounts

From now on, when TPP sends `Account List` (`GET /v1/accounts`) request with `withBalance` parameter
and AIS Consent access rights given to dedicated accounts and number of accounts exceeds number of balances,
TPP in this case will receive 401 response code with `CONSENT_INVALID` message.

## Delete deprecated columns in `crypto_algorithm` table

Columns `algorithm`, `version`, `key_length_in_bytes`, `hash_iterations`, `skf_algorithm` were deleted in `crypto_algorithm`
table. Corresponding liquibase script file `0068-remove-deprecated-columns-from-crypto-algorithm-table.xml` was added.

## Bugfix: field `aspspAccountId` no longer available for SPI.

From now on, the `aspspAccoundId` field is present on SPI level and can be read by using CMS-PSU-API.

## Bugfix: Xs2a should respond with error 401 'CERTIFICATE_INVALID' if TPP has no appropriate role for requested service

From now on, while sending HTTP requests to the XS2A for all components (AIS, PIS or PIIS)
where TPP does not have roles for using current endpoint then response contains an error 'CERTIFICATE_INVALID' and HTTP code is 401
