== Refactor: ASPSP consent data refactoring

From now on, the data in SPI level communication is changed. Before, we used `AspspConsentData` object to store the byte array of ASPSP consent data and this object was used in all SPI methods signature as a parameter.
After this refactoring, new provider is used instead of this object: `SpiAspspConsentDataProvider`. This provider is transferred from XS2A
to SPI level and can be used for storing (`updateAspspConsentData` method) and loading (`loadAspspConsentData` method) the ASPSP consent data.
So, now the SPI developers should change their connectors according to these changes: replace the `AspspConsentData` parameter with
`SpiAspspConsentDataProvider` parameter in the SPI implementation.
Also, field `aspspConsentData` and method `success()` were removed as deprecated from `SpiResponse` entity. Please use method `build()` instead.

Please note: from now on, the SPI developers are responsible for saving the ASPSP consent data to the database. XS2A-Core provides this possibility, but if no updateAspspConsentData call happens, no data will be saved.
