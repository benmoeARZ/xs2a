== Bugfix: Fix the payment ID transfer flow during payment cancellation
From now on, response to the Payment Cancellation Request (`DELETE /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}`)
will contain links with external (encrypted) payment ID instead of internal one.

== Bugfix: Account reference is properly validated during confirmation of funds
From now on, account reference in the Funds Confirmation Request (`POST /v1/funds-confirmations`)
will be properly validated (both account identifier and currency).
