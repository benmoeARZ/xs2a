=== ASPSP Consent Data

ASPSP Consent Data represents a holder for session information storage between synchronous unauthorised API requests.

I.e. getting information about transactions and balances about some account requires authorisation in some banking systems,
given by the account holder or some banking subsystem.
Such authorisation is performed in XS2A using the consents. If TPP has got a valid consent, authorised by PSU,
he should be able to access the data about accounts listed in this consent. To provide a technical possibility for such access,
some authorisation information shall be stored between TPP requests using the consent.

The XS2A Service itself is stateless, request from TPP is proxied to SPI-Connector level, that is supposed to obtain necessary information from the banking system and deliver it back.
The only one place to save such information is the Consent (Payment in case of PIS Use-case) record in CMS.
Therefore we provide the ASPSP Consent Data concept to store and use such information from CMS, linked to the Consent/Payment record.

The rules are:

1. ASPSP Consent Data is a raw array of bytes. XS2A doesn't parse or use this data.
It is a decision of SPI-Connector developer what to put into the ASPSP Consent Data and what format to use.

2. ASPSP Consent Data is accessible inside the every call to SPI API, so that any connector method has access to the scope of request.

3. Developer of SPI-Connector is responsible to update/delete ASPSP Consent data to update/revoke access to accounts.

4. ASPSP Consent data is stored per Consent/Payment and delivered to SPI Level based on corresponding Consent ID.

5. ASPSP Consent Data is stored encrypted in CMS. Encryption key is not available in the bank side.

The principle how SpiAspspConsentDataProvider is instantiated and used on SPI Connector level is displayed on diagram:

==== Encryption of ASPSP Consent Data

*Problem:*
Since ASPSP Consent Data might contain important customer information or access data (logins, passwords, tokens etc.),
it should be stored encrypted without a possibility to access and use this data without appropriate request from TPP.

*Solution:*
In order to achieve this we allow TPP to save the encryption key and do not hold it on our side.
Since Berlin Group specification contains no separate field for it, we use Consent ID (Payment ID for PIS use-case)
to store encryption key in it.

*Problem:*
The encryption algorithms are subject to change in a while. And old data,
encrypted with old algorithm shall be still possible to use.

*Solution:*
Since consents normally live not more than 90 days, we can simply fix the encryption algorithm used for each particular consent.

*Problem:*
Encryption key shall not be available in any place in ASPSP systems, also not in the log-files.

*Solution:*
Consent ID and encryption key are concatenated and encrypted again with second symmetric key (predefined).


===== Encryption of AspspConsentData
Encryption is solved in CMS library and contains of several steps:

===== Decryption of AspspConsentData
Decryption is solved in CMS library and contains of several steps:
