== Strong customer authentication
Following transactions require strong customer authentication (SCA) of the PSU at the XS2A interface as part of the transaction:

* Payment initiation transactions.
* Cancellation initiation transactions (depending on the regulations for this kind of
  transactions at the user interfaces offered by the ASPSP to the PSU directly).
* Establish account information consent transactions.

=== SCA Approaches
XS2A Interface supports multiple SCA approaches. https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a/tree/develop/aspsp-profile[ASPSP-Profile] may contain a list of approaches (in order of priority - first one with the highest priority).
Choice of SCA approach also depends on header parameter in initial request - TPP-Redirect-Preferred.
If TPP-Redirect-Preferred is true and ASPSP supports REDIRECT approach, then REDIRECT approach is used. Otherwise first approach in ASPSP-profile is used.

|Option |Meaning |Value

|scaApproaches
|List of SCA Approaches supported by ASPSP ordered by priority
|REDIRECT, EMBEDDED, DECOUPLED
|===

==== SCA using the redirect approach
For the redirect approach the individual steps of the SCA are not executed at the XS2A interface, but directly between the PSU and the ASPSP. In this case, the PSU is redirected to a web interface of the ASPSP for authentication.
Once the PSU has been redirected to the ASPSP (app or web interface) the SCA of the PSU is executed step by step and directly between the ASPSP and the PSU. After completion of the SCA the PSU is redirected back to the TPP.

==== SCA using the decoupled approach
The transaction flow of the decoupled approach to SCA is similar to that of the redirect approach. The difference is that the ASPSP asks the PSU to authenticate e.g. by sending a push notification with payment transaction details to a dedicated mobile app or via any other application or device which is independent of the online banking frontend.
The first factor of authorisation process is executed on XS2A side and the second one through the bank application

==== SCA using the embedded approach
When applying the embedded approach the SCA of the PSU is executed entirely as part of the transaction at the XS2A interface.

==== Explicit/Implicit start of authorisation
Explicit start of authorisation is supported in case of Multilevel SCA and in case of Signing Basket, otherwise there is implicit start of authorisation.

==== Authorisation (SCA) Statuses
Statuses which are defined finalised:

* Finalised (The SCA routine has been finalised successfully)
* Failed(The SCA routine failed)
* Exempted (SCA was exempted for the related transaction, the related authorisation is successful)

After setting finalised status for Authorisation status isn't allowed to be changed in CMS any more.

== Payment Initiation Service
The support of this service at the XS2A interface is mandatory.
Transactions according to this use case can be used to initiate a single payment in form of a credit transfer from an account of the PSU to an account of the payee.
While the transaction at the XS2A interface is initiated by the TPP, it must first be initiated by the PSU at the PSU – TPP interface.
The ASPSP will reject the transaction if the TPP cannot be identified correctly at the XS2A interface and/or if it does not have the role PISP. Subject to the decision of the ASPSP, strong customer authentication of the PSU has to be executed.

Current version of the XS2A Interface supports the following types of payments:

* Single payment
* Future dated single payment
* Bulk payment
* Recurring payment

=== Payment Initiation Service in Embedded Approach

image::paymentInitEmbedded.png[Payment Initiation in Embedded Approach, title='Payment Initiation in Embedded Approach', align='center']

=== Payment statuses
Payment transaction status is synchronised in bank's database and in CMS. When payment data with payment transaction status is given from ASPSP, status will be updated in CMS, even if it is already finalised. There is endpoint in cms-aspsp-api to set payment data with payment transaction status directly from ASPSP to CMS.

Status settlement:

* Not confirmed with SCA payments obsolete after a certain period. Payment Transaction Status becomes "rejected" and Sca Status for dedicated payment authorisation becomes "failed".
* In case TPP tries to initiate new authorisation for expired payment, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 403 RESOURCE_EXPIRED.
* In case of usage non-existent payment-id XS2A sends response with HTTP code 404 RESOURCE_UNKNOWN.


The transaction statuses of the payment initiation resource which are defined as *Finalised*:

* *Cancelled* (Payment initiation has been cancelled before execution).
* *Rejected* (Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected).
* *AcceptedSettlementCompleted* (indicating that the money has been booked already from the debtor account).

After setting finalised status for payment :

* status isn't allowed to be changed in CMS any more (except the case when ASPSP updates is directly in CMS)
* new authorisation sub-resource can't be created
* cancellation can't be proceeded

=== Payment Cancellation
The support of this use case at the XS2A interface is optional.
A TPP may execute a transaction according to this use case to cancel a (still pending) payment, which has been initiated before. Only future dated payments and recurring payments may be cancelled.

NOTE: It is up to the ASPSP to decide if a given payment can still be cancelled or not.

Depending on SpiPaymentCancellationResponse properties *transactionStatus* and *cancellationAuthorisationMandated*:

* XS2A starts authorisation process of payment cancellation only for authorised payments (which were sent and accepted by ASPSP).
* When payment is finished (has one of transaction statuses Cancelled, Rejected, AcceptedSettlementCompleted) there isn't possibility to cancel it or to proceed payment cancellation authorisation flow. In this case XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 400 FORMAT_ERROR and output "Payment is finalised already and cannot be cancelled".
* If the payment is initiated and authorisation is not finished yet, then it is not yet sent to ASPSP and cancellation will be done without authorisation, even if ASPSP supports authorisation for cancellation of payment.

== Account Information Service
=== Establish account information consent
The support of this endpoint at the XS2A interface is mandatory.
A TPP may execute transactions according to this use case to receive the right to execute further transactions according to the other use cases of the account information service. Subject to consent of the PSU, the TPP can obtain the following rights for transactions (of the account information service):

* Get the list of reachable accounts of the PSU once.
* Get the balances for a list of accounts once or multiple times.
* Get payment transaction information for a list of accounts once or multiple times.

==== XS2A performs validation of :

* TPP data from certificate in request is compared in CMS with TPP data in Consent:
* Account data should be requested by the same TPP which was given a Consent (TPP Reg_Num = tpp_id). In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 400 CONSENT_UNKNOWN.
* First check should be for consent access, and then for expiration.
* The consent is considered ready to be used by the TPP to access the AIS service when the status is VALID. A consent with RECEIVED status does not have an access token yet. If TPP wants to get account details, transactions and balances with consent which status is Received, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID.
* In case of usage non-existent consent-id XS2A sends response  with HTTP code 403 CONSENT_UNKNOWN.

=== Account Information Service in Embedded approach
image::ConsentInitEmbedded.png[Consent Initiation in Embedded Approach, title='Consent Initiation in Embedded Approach', align='center']

==== Consent Models
The XS2A supports four different consent models:

===== Consent on Dedicated Accounts:
Creates an account information consent resource at the ASPSP regarding access to accounts specified in this request.

* All permitted "access" attributes ("accounts", "balances" and "transactions") used in this message shall carry a non-empty array of account references, indicating the accounts where the type of access is requested.

+
NOTE: that a "transactions" or "balances" access right also gives access to the generic /accounts endpoints, i.e. is implicitly supporting also the "accounts" access.
+
Consent on Dedicated Accounts affects on response body for all account endpoints:

** Get consent request
** Read account list
** Read account details
** Read balance
** Read transaction list
** Read transaction details
+
* When this Consent Request is a request where the “recurringIndicator” equals true, and if it exists already a former consent for recurring access on account information for the addressed PSU and potentially addressed corporate identification submitted by this TPP, then the former consent automatically expires as soon as the new consent request is authorised by the PSU.
There are no expiration side effects foreseen for Consent Requests where the “recurringIndicator” equals false.
* When this Consent Request is a request for one access to the account data then "recurringIndicator" equals false and "frequencyPerDay" should not be more than "1".


===== Consent on Account List of Available Accounts
This function implies a consent resource at the ASPSP to return a list of all available accounts, resp. all available accounts with its balances.

The ability to create Consent on Account List of Available Accounts depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSP Profile "availableAccountsConsentSupported" should be set to "TRUE".
* The call only contains the "availableAccounts" or “availableAccountsWithBalances” sub attribute within the "access" attribute with value "allAccounts".
* All possible content of "accounts", "balances", "transactions" fields is ignored if call contains attribute "availableAccounts" or “availableAccountsWithBalances”.
* Applying one or two-factor authorisation depends on the value  of the parameter in ASPSP profile "scaByOneTimeAvailableAccountsConsentRequired" (true (by default), false)
* When in profile parameter “scaByOneTimeAvailableAccountsConsentRequired”=false, request contains reccuringIndicator=false and in SPIResponse "multilevelSca"=true, then multilevel flag is ignored and Consent become "Valid" after execution one-factor authorisation (login and password) by one PSU.

===== Bank Offered Consent

This function implies a consent without indication of Accounts. The ASPSP will then agree bilaterally directly with the PSU on which accounts the requested access consent should be supported.
The ability to create Bank Offered Consent depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSP Profile "bankOfferedConsentSupport" should be set to "TRUE",
* The call contains the "accounts", "balances" and/or "transactions" sub attribute within the "access" attribute all with an empty array.
* For this function the Embedded SCA Approach is not supported.

===== Global Consent
This function implies a consent on all available accounts of the PSU on all PSD2 related account information services (meaning access to all account endpoints including balances and transactions).
Global consent can be recurring and one-off.

The ability to create Global Consent depends on successful validation:

* The attribute in ASPSP Profile "allPsd2Support" should be set to "TRUE".
* The call contains the "allPsd2" sub attribute within the "access" attribute with the value "allAccounts".
* All possible content of "accounts", "balances", "transactions", "availableAccounts" or “availableAccountsWithBalances” fields is ignored if call contains attribute "allPsd2".
* Applying one or two-factor authorisation depends on the value  of the parameter in ASPSP profile "scaByOneTimeGlobalConsentRequired" (true (by default), false)

==== Consent expiration date
All requests to the CMS concerning any consentID should be validated for parameter "validUntil" (mandatory field). The parameter "validUntil" is adjusted for Consent in CMS according to parameter in ASPSP Profile "consentLifetime":

* if parameter "consentLifetime" = 0 or empty, then the maximum lifetime of Consent is infinity. Therefore no adjustment should be applied. 
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0, then the limit of a maximum lifetime of Consent is set in days and “ValidUntil” should be adjusted and stored in CMS with new value. For example, date of Consent request is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “9999-12-31" and "consentLifetime"=10, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get new adjusted value by Get consent request.
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0 and “ValidUntil” contains date far than it is allowed by bank, then there should be adjustment to the date according "consentLifetime". For example, date of Consent request creation is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “2019-04-20" and "consentLifetime"=10, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get new adjusted value by Get consent request;
* if parameter "consentLifetime" > 0 and “ValidUntil” contains date less than it could be allowed by bank, then no adjustment should be applied. For example, date of Consent request creation is 2019-03-01, “ValidUntil” is “2019-03-10" and "consentLifetime"=15, then adjusted value of “ValidUntil” should be 2019-03-10. And TPP will get "ValidUntil” =2019-03-10 by Get consent request;
* If the date of "validUntil" is in the past, then XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_EXPIRED.
* In case TPP tries to initiate new authorisation for expired consent, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 403 CONSENT_EXPIRED.

==== Counting of frequencyPerDay
This attribute indicates the requested maximum frequency for an access without PSU involvement per day. For a one-off access, this attribute is set to "1"."


Number of TPP accesses is counted by every endpoint:

* /accounts
* /accounts/account-id per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/balances per account-id
* /accounts/account-id/transactions/transaction-id per account-id and transaction-id, if applicable.

If the amount of accesses for any of these endpoints is exceeded - HTTP error 429 ACCESS_EXCEEDED is returned. All other endpoints are still accessible until their amount is not exceeded.

===== Frequency is addressing only the Read Account Data Requests without PSU involvement:

* When any GET Account Data Requests contain filled parameter PSU-IP-Address, then frequencyPerDay isn't counted for this request with recurring consent.
* For one-off consent PSU-IP-Address is ignored and frequencyPerDay is counted.

==== Get consent Status Request
Field *lastActionDate* - is containing the date of the last action on the consent object either through the XS2A interface or the PSU/ASPSP interface having an impact on the status:

* When consent is created and gets status "Received" - lastActionDate contains date of consent creation.
* When consent status is changed - lastActionDate also is updated with new date.

==== Consent statuses
The status of the consent (the data element "consentStatus")resource is changing during the initiation process. In difference to the payment initiation process, there are only SCA checks on the consent resource and no feedback loop with the ASPSP backend.

Status settlement:

* While creating consent, In case of existing old unauthorised  recurring consent (status "received") for one TPP and one PSU - its consent status becomes "rejected",  as soon as new recurring one becomes authorised (consent status set to VALID).
* While creating consent, In case of existing old recurring authorised consent for one TPP and one PSU - its consent status becomes "Terminated_by_TPP" as soon as new recurring consent becomes authorised (consent status set to VALID).
* Consent without successful authorisation expire after a certain period. Consent Status becomes "rejected" and Sca Status for consent authorisation becomes "failed".

Consent Statuses which are defined as *Finalised*:

* *Rejected* (The consent data is rejected e.g. since no successful authorisation takes place)
* *RevokedByPSU* (The consent has been revoked by the PSU)
* *Expired* (The consent has been expired (e.g. after 90 days)
* *TerminatedByTpp* (The corresponding TPP has terminated the consent by applying the DELETE method to the consent resource)

After setting finalised status for consent:

* status isn't allowed to be changed in CMS any more.
* new authorisation sub-resource can't be created

=== Read Account Data Requests
For all Read Account Data Requests:

* Read Account List
* Read Account Details
* Read Balance
* Read Transaction List
* Read Transaction Details

the *PSU-IP-Address added to the request header* definitions with the Condition "Conditional" and the following description to identify PSU involvement: "The forwarded IP Address header field consists of the corresponding HTTP request IP Address field between PSU and TPP. It shall be contained if and only if this request was actively initiated by the PSU."


==== Granted Permission in appropriate Consent:
* For Get accounts with balances (query parameter *withBalance = true* ) validate if permission exists in the Consent.  In case when validation is unsuccessful, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID and output "The consent was created by this TPP but is not valid for the addressed service/resource".
* According to Specification 1.3: To have possibility to get balances or transactions or account data, TPP needs to know account-id - this identification is denoting the addressed account. The account-id is retrieved by using a “Read Account List” call. The account-id is the “resourceId” attribute of the account structure. Its value is constant at least throughout the lifecycle of a given consent. So after consent is expired - ASPSP may change account-ids and after establishing new consent TPP will need a new call to get account-ids.
* If Get account request has *"withBalance=true"* query parameter and Consent permission is valid - response should contain array of balances for account which was granted consent for balances. And it doesn't influence on links.
* If Get account request has *"withBalance=false"* query parameter - response should not contain array of balances. And it doesn't influence on links.
* In case of access not granted for balances or transactions, XS2A sends the response with HTTP code 401 CONSENT_INVALID.
* Links balances and transactions should appear in Get Account response according to Consent access.

=== Read Account List

=== Read Account Details

=== Read Balance

=== Read Transaction List
The support of "Get transaction information for a given account" at the XS2A interface is mandatory. 

The TPP can use transactions according to this use case to receive information about payment transactions of a specific account. As a result the TPP will receive information about all payment transactions executed during the time period indicated in the request. In addition, the ASPSP might return also the booking balance.

In addition, the ASPSP can optionally offer the service of a delta report. In this case, the ASPSP is delivering only the information about payment transaction since the last access of this TPP to this account information service or it is delivering the information about payment transaction starting with the next transaction of a payment transaction with a given transaction identification.

.Read Transaction List (Delta report)
|===
|Attribute |Condition |Description |Term of use

4+|*TPP may ask transaction list for some period, which is defined by parameters dateFrom and dateTo, or report for some delta access*
|dateFrom
|Conditional
|Starting date of the transaction list

|*Mandated* if no delta access is required (no entryReferenceFrom or deltaList in request). Might be ignored if a delta function is used.
|dateTo
|Optional
|End of the transaction list

|If not given - default is "now" (for the period from “dateFrom” till “now”).

 Might be ignored if a delta function is used
4+|*Delta access is represented by one of two query parameters in Read Transaction List request:*
|entryReferenceFrom
|Optional if supported by API provider

|This data attribute is indicating that the AISP is in favor to get all transactions after the transaction with identification entryReferenceFrom alternatively to the above defined period
|If this data element is contained, the entries "dateFrom" and "dateTo" might be ignored by the ASPSP in case of a delta report is supported (ASPSP-profile contains parameter "entryReferenceFrom" = true).

 This delta indicator might be rejected by the ASPSP if this function is not supported (in ASPSP-profile "entryReferenceFrom" = false), in this case in response an error should be sent "PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED" code 400
|deltaList
|Optional if supported by API provider

|This data attribute is indicating that the AISP is in favor to get all transactions after the last report access for this PSU
|If this data element is contained, the entries "dateFrom" and "dateTo" might be ignored by the ASPSP in case of a delta report is supported (ASPSP-profile contains parameter "deltaList " = true).

 This delta indicator might be rejected by the ASPSP if this function is not supported (in ASPSP-profile "deltaList" =false), in this case in response an error should be sent "PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED" code 400
4+|- Transaction List Response should contain parameter "entryReference" for every sent transaction (for both reports – with parameter “deltaList” and “entryReferenceFrom”, if supported by ASPSP)

- If request contains both optional Query Parameters "deltaList" and "entryReferenceFrom", then  Read Transaction List  response contains http code 400 FORMAT_ERROR (Only one delta report query parameter can be present in request)
|bookingStatus

|Mandatory
|Permitted codes are "booked", "pending" and "both"

 "booked" shall be supported by the ASPSP.

 To support the "pending" and "both" feature is optional for the ASPSP
|In case of usage parameters which are not supported ( not contains in ASPSP-Profile "availableBookingStatuses") response is send "PARAMETER_NOT_SUPPORTED" code 400
|withBalance

|Optional
|If contained, this function reads the list of transactions including the booking balance, if granted by the PSU in the related consent and available by the ASPSP. This parameter might be ignored by the ASPSP

== Common features
=== Support of Relative and Global links in responses
In https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a/tree/develop/aspsp-profile[ASPSP Profile] support of relative links look like:
```
forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl: true
xs2aBaseLinksUrl: "/"
```
- If `forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl` is set to `true`, links in responses (except "scaRedirect") shall be generated with the base URL set by `xs2aBaseLinksUrl`:

1. xs2aBaseLinksUrl="/" - for relative link;
2. xs2aBaseLinksUrl="`http://myhost.com/`" - for global link;

- If `forceXs2aBaseLinksUrl` is set to `false`, links in responses (except "scaRedirect") shall be generated with the base URL of controller (as it is now)
